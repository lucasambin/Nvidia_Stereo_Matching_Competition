In this work we are focusing on designing and deploy the Stereo Matching (SM) approach that has an acceptable tradeoff between the speedest and the most accurate one. To come with this aim we implemented 2 algorithm , the classical Celsus Semi-Global Matching and a Hybrid algorithm that exploit the acceleration and low memory consuption of the traditional approaches and the learning methods as Deep Learning (DL) what is termed StereoVae.
